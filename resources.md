# Resources

We produce a range of learning and teaching materials for social scientists interested in developing their understanding of and skills in new forms of data.

## Webinars

These are short (c. 30-40 minute) videos where we describe and demonstrate a new form of data. To date [2020-03-26] the following webinars are available via the UK Data Service Youtube channel:
* Agent-based Modelling
  * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twpg3j9dnG0" target="_blank">Introduction to agent-based modelling for social scientists</a>
  * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0oeeRaamEM" target="_blank">Conducting experiments, recording output and analysing results of agent-based modelling</a>
  * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CAzJjYYtlE" target="_blank">Adding real world GIS and census data to agent-based modelling for social scientists</a>

## Interactive notebooks

These are electronic documents containing programming code - similar to Stata or R syntax files - that you can execute and edit from a web browser (no installation necessary).
They are created using the <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebook</a> software application.
